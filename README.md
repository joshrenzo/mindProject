# Project Description
## Motivation
Since the advent of COVID-19, the world has seen an unprecedented amount of hospitalizations due to the virus outbreak. In the United States alone, we have seen over 200,000 COVID-related deaths. Of the 200,000 deaths, around 900 were nurses who were working on the front-line in the fight against the virus. Many of these nurses contracted COVID from patients they were treating. As a result, these brave nurses soon found themselves becoming patients in the very hospitals they worked in. In these hard times, we must make sure to protect our nurses as they are the ones who will lead us through this pandemic.

## Solution
This team will focus on the protection of nurses by introducing a novel, non-contact device that will allow nurses to take patient vitals while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission due to close proximity. This device will take the form of a Smart Biomedical Seat. Patients will be able to sit in a chair-like device within the hospital waiting room. Once seated, the device will automatically measure the vital signs of the patient and transfer this information to the hospital network. Once there, doctors will be able to access all patient vitals from any network connected device.
