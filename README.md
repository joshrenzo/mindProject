## Project Description
### Motivation
Since the advent of COVID-19, the world has seen an unprecedented amount of hospitalizations due to the virus outbreak. In the United States alone, we have seen over 200,000 COVID-related deaths. Of the 200,000 deaths, around 900 were nurses serving on the front-line in the fight against the virus. Many of these nurses contracted COVID from patients they were treating. As a result, these brave nurses soon found themselves becoming patients in the very hospitals they worked in. In these hard times, we must take large strides to protect our nurses as they are the ones who will guide us through this pandemic.

### Solution
This team will focus on the protection of nurses by introducing a novel, non-contact device that will allow nurses to take patient vitals while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission due to close proximity. We call this breakthrough innovation **Olakino+**. Our solution takes the form of a seemingly normal hospital waiting room chair. However, Olakino+ is anything but normal.

Underneath the soft cushioning, Olakino+ sports an array of biomedical sensors ranging from thermometers to pulse oximeters. When a patient sits on this chair, Olakino+ will automatically measure the vital signs of the patient and save this information to the hospital network. Once saved, hospital staff will be able to access all patient data from any network connected device. This way, if any highly infectious diseases ever arise, hospitals will still be able to take patient vitals while protecting their nurses from viral infection due to close proximity with infected patients.
